# Elm Plugin for Protocol Buffers [![build status](https://github.com/andreasewering/protoc-gen-elm/actions/workflows/build_and_test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/andreasewering/protoc-gen-elm/actions)

This [`protoc`](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/) plug-in generates [Elm](https://elm-lang.org/) modules from `.proto` specification files. The generated modules make use of the [elm-protocol-buffers](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/eriktim/elm-protocol-buffers/latest/) library to handle the (de)serialization. They can be used to transmit bytes over HTTP(S) or via web-sockets. 

Remote Procedure Call (RPC) generation is currently experimental and locked behind setting the environment variable `EXPERIMENTAL_GRPC=true`. If used, you need to add a dependency on the [elm-grpc](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/andreasewering/elm-grpc/latest/) library.

**Take a look [here](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/) for a general introduction on Protocol Buffers.**

## Installation

This package is a plug-in for `protoc`, make sure you have [installed](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/downloads) it and `protoc` is available on your path. After installing `protoc-gen-elm` globally from NPM, `protoc` will automatically find the binary when you add the `--elm_out` flag to your command.

```
npm install --global protoc-gen-elm
```

**You can now turn any `.proto` file into an Elm module**. A similar approach can be used to generate code for C++, Dart, Go, Java, Python, Ruby, C#, Objective C, JavaScript, PHP or [another language](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/blob/master/docs/third_party.md) to build a compliant back-end server!

```
protoc --elm_out=. api.proto
```

## Overview

The following table gives an overview of how `.proto` types correspond to Elm types and what their default values are.

\*) 64-bit integers are defined in [`elm-protocol-buffers`](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/eriktim/elm-protocol-buffers) in `Protobuf.Types.Int64`.

\*\*) Some default values can be overridden in `proto2` specifications

## Live Example

To run a live example in your browser, first start the example back-end server:

```bash
npm install
node example/server.js
```

The server implements a (basic) back-end for `example/greeter.proto`. You can now generate an Elm module from the same specification. The example code will use the generated `example/src/Proto.Greeter.elm` to communicate with the server. Start the reactor and give it a try on http://localhost:8000/src/Main.elm:

```bash
cd example
protoc --elm_out=src greeter.proto
elm reactor
```

## Well-known types

If you want to use protobufs [well-known-types](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/google.protobuf), 
you need to include the paths to the proto files in the compilation.

Example: If this is your proto file `test.proto` which uses the well-known type `Timestamp`,
```
import "google/protobuf/timestamp.proto";

message TestMessage {
  google.protobuf.Timestamp timestamp = 1;
}
```

the `protoc` invocation will need to include the path to the well-known types .proto file.
```
protoc --elm_out=. test.proto /usr/local/include/google/protobuf/timestamp.proto
```

## Limitations

- All limitations of [`elm-protocol-buffers`](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/eriktim/elm-protocol-buffers/latest#known-limitations) apply;
- This is still a **beta** release. Please report any issues you have generating your Elm modules;

## Development

Note: Currently, this project won't run on Windows (WSL works) because of shell scripts/executable js files.

Execute `npm install`, `npm run build` and `npm test` and you should be good to go.
You will need `protoc` installed and on your PATH.

- The plugin logic is written in Elm itself. To be executable via node, there is a index.js wrapper. It converts the incoming bytes to base64, because there currently is no way to directly send the type `Bytes` through a port.
- Main.elm essentially wires up the binding to JS: A request is received through a port, gets decoded, processed and then sent through another port.
- For decoding the protoc request, it uses "itself", meaning that upgrading protoc versions should be done by running the plugin against the new `include` files from protoc to generate the new encoders/decoders.
- A `Mapper` converts the request into a convenient internal structure
- A `Generator` then uses this internal structure to build an Elm AST
  which is then pretty-printed to a file.
