# Tonic + Vite Example

This example is more of a real world application (a basic todo application).

## Server

Run `cargo build` to download the Rust dependencies and built Rust code from the `todos.proto` file.

With `cargo run`, the server should start on port 3000.

One of the cool things about the Rust `Tonic` Framework is that it does not need a seperate proxy server to understand grpc-web requests.

## Client

Run `npm start`. 
Vite will

- Generate Elm files from `todos.proto`
- Compile Elm to JS
- Serve the files on port 5173
- Proxy requests to `/todos` to port 3000
- Reload the browser window (or hot reload) if files change

Since the requests are proxied, no CORS on the server is necessary.

The UI is very ugly since this is just an example to get you going :)

## Hypothetical deployment

Typically Vite is what you use in development and not in production.
So how do you deploy this?

My approach would be to run something like `nginx` as a reverse-proxy
and let it serve the files generated by `vite build`.
